Memory Game Project

Memory Game is a complete browser-based card matching game (also known as Concentration). written in JavaScript for the Udacity Front-End Nanodegree Program.


Game Rules

The gameplay rules are very simple: Click two cards at a time and try to match the pairs!
Each turn:

	. The player flips one card over to reveal its underlying symbol.
	. The player then turns over a second card, trying to find the corresponding card with the same symbol.
	. If the cards match, both cards stay flipped over.
	. If the cards do not match, both cards are flipped face down.
	. The game ends once all cards have been correctly matched.
